Advanced Encryption Standard

The more popular and widely adopted symmetric encryption algorithm likely to be encountered nowadays is the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES).

The features of AES are as follows:
1. Symmetric key symmetric block cipher
2. 128-bit data, 128/192/256-bit keys
3. Stronger and faster than Triple-DES
4. Provide full specification and design details
5. Software implementable in C and Java
